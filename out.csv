We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the AP system by performing a hydrodynamic simulation using a mechanical mock circulation system and fetal animal experiment. The effect of the working condition of the AP system on the fetal hemodynamics was evaluated by hydrodynamic simulation using a mechanical mock circulation system, assuming the weight of the fetus to be 2 kg. The AP system was introduced to two fetal goats at a gestational age of 135 days. The general conditions of the experimental animals were evaluated. The mock simulation showed that in an AP system with ECMO in the form of an umbilical arterial-venous connection in series, it could be difficult to maintain fetal hemodynamics when high ECMO flow was applied. The developed AP system could have high ECMO flow with less umbilical blood flow; however, the possibility of excessive load on the fetal right-sided heart should be noted. In the animal experiment, kid 1 (1.9 kg) was maintained on the AP system for 12 days and allowed to grow to term. In kid 2 (1.6 kg), the AP system could not be established because of the occlusion of the system by a thrombus. The developed AP system was feasible under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Improvements in the AP system and management of the general fetal conditions are essential.",kid

A large number of indiscriminate research reports on BBG have been published; however, the review on the productive and reproductive performances with different physiological features of BBG in Bangladesh is scarce. This review was conducted to investigate and summarize the available research reports on BBGs to highlight the gaps and provide coherent recommendations for the future research plan for sustainable BBG production in Bangladesh. It covers research works in morphometric features, feeding and nutrition, reproduction, diseases and health management, husbandry practices, and production performances of BBG under local conditions. Due to the contemporary increased demand for animal protein (meat and milk), the scope of small ruminants, especially goat farming, increases with other large ruminants farming. The key constraints of BBG production in Bangladesh include higher disease prevalence with low or no management practices, kid mortality, inadequate feeds and fodder supply, and poor marketing channel with some other stumpy genetic potentialities (slower body weight gain, low milk production) of this goat. Future research would be required to assess the contribution of BBG to household economies and food securities throughout the year and evaluate the constraints, adaptation and extension of artificial insemination (AI), and genetic improvement of economically important traits using molecular techniques and the selective breeding program.",kid

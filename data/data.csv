Social interaction can select for reduced ability.,10.1098/rspb.2022.1788,36259207,"Animals, including humans, differ in a wide range of physical and cognitive abilities ranging from measures of running speed and physical strength to learning ability and intelligence. We consider the evolution of ability when individuals interact pairwise over their contribution to a common good. In this interaction, the contribution of each is assumed to be the best given their own ability and the contribution of their partner. Since there is a tendency for individuals to partially compensate for a low contribution by their partner, low-ability individuals can do well. As a consequence, for benefit and cost structures for which individuals have a strong response to partner's contribution, there can be selection for reduced ability. Furthermore, there can be disruptive selection on ability, leading to a bimodal distribution of ability under some modes of inheritance.",2022-10-20,"John M McNamara, Max Wolf",game,0
How the epidemiology of disease-resistant and disease-tolerant varieties affects grower behaviour.,10.1098/rsif.2022.0517,36259173,"Population-scale effects of resistant or tolerant crop varieties have received little consideration from epidemiologists. When growers deploy tolerant crop, population-scale disease pressures are often unaffected. This only benefits growers using tolerant varieties, selfishly decreasing yields for others. However, resistant crop can reduce disease pressure for all. We coupled an epidemiological model with game theory to understand how this affects uptake of control. Each time a grower plants a new crop, they must decide whether to use an improved (i.e. tolerant/resistant) or unimproved variety. This decision is based on strategic-adaptive expectations in our model, with growers comparing last season's profit with an estimate of what is expected from the alternative crop. Despite the positive feedback loop promoting use of a tolerant variety whenever it is available, a mixed unimproved- and tolerant-crop equilibrium can persist. Tolerant crop can also induce bistability between a scenario in which all growers use tolerant crop and the disease-free equilibrium, where no growers do. However, due to 'free-riding' by growers of unimproved crop, resistant crop nearly always exists in a mixed equilibrium. This work highlights how growers respond to contrasting incentives caused by tolerant and resistant varieties, and the distinct effects on yields and population-scale deployment.",2022-10-20,"Rachel E Murray-Watson, Nik J Cunniffe",game,1
Developing a digital game for excel skills learning in higher education - a comparative study analyzing differences in learning between digital games and textbook learning.,10.1007/s10639-022-11335-7,36259080,"In higher education, many universities in Taiwan let college students learn excel in a self-directed way. The current axle of the Excel curriculum mainly relies on self-directed learning. In the study, we designed the digital game ""Legendary Wizard Excel"" and took a certified Excel textbook as the research tool. The game we designed integrated the role-play with cognitive scaffolding to help learners learn Excel skills, whereas the textbook we used was ""Excel Expert"" in the Microsoft Office Specialist. We compared the Learning Effectiveness, Flow Status, and Technology Acceptance Model with 187 college students between two tools, and found that: (1) The game reached a high Technology Acceptance Model; (2) Both groups of learners had significant improvements in learning effectiveness and were engaged in the activity; (3) On learning effectiveness, learners in game-based learning groups achieved higher than learners in textbook groups; (4) Learners in game-based learning groups engaged better in the activity than learners in textbook groups. Therefore, in the future, we looked forward to bringing our results to higher education levels and workplace training to enhance the Excel skills.",2022-10-20,"Man-Ying Chen, Joni Tzuchen Tang",game,1
Willingness to pay for policies to reduce health risks from COVID-19: Evidence from U.S. professional sports.,10.1002/hec.4618,36258641,"Airborne transmission of the COVID-19 virus increased the need for health policies to reduce transmission in congregate settings associated with minimal risk before the pandemic. While a large literature estimates tradeoffs between policies designed to reduce negative health outcomes, no empirical research addresses consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for health policies designed to reduce airborne virus transmission. Using survey data from 1381 fans of professional sports, we estimate consumers' WTP for reduced likelihood of coronavirus transmission through mask and social distancing policies using a stated preference approach. The results indicate increased attendance likelihood if the venue requires masks and limits attendance, with significant heterogeneity in WTP across risk scenarios and sports. We characterize consumers as casual fans who prefer a mask requirement but are indifferent to capacity constraints, strong fans who are anti-maskers and prefer capacity constraints, and a second group of casual fans with positive WTP under both mask and limited capacity requirements. For example, casual fans' WTP for masking, $38 per National Basketball Association (NBA) game attended, is more than double their WTP for capacity constraints only. Strong fans' WTP for attending capacity constrained NBA games was $490, more than 400% higher than the pre-pandemic average WTP of $105.",2022-10-20,"Brad R Humphreys, Gary A Wagner, John C Whitehead, Pamela Wicker",game,1
Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides in the blood of obligate and facultative european avian scavengers.,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120385,36257565,"The widespread use of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) and their high persistence in animal tissues has led to these compounds becoming ubiquitous in rodent-predator-scavenger food webs. Exposure to SGARs has usually been investigated in wildlife species found dead, and despite growing evidence of the potential risk of secondary poisoning of predators and scavengers, the current worldwide exposure of free-living scavenging birds to SGARs remains scarcely investigated. We present the first active monitoring of blood SGAR concentrations and prevalence in the four European obligate (i.e., vultures) and facultative (red and black kites) avian scavengers in NE Spain. We analysed 261 birds and detected SGARs in 39.1% (n = 102) of individuals. Both SGAR prevalence and concentrations (ΣSGARs) were related to the age and foraging behaviour of the species studied. Black kites showed the highest prevalence (100%), followed by red kites (66.7%), Egyptian (64.2%), bearded (20.9%), griffon (16.9%) and cinereous (6.3%) vultures. Overall, both the prevalence and average ΣSGARs were higher in non-nestlings than nestlings, and in species such as kites and Egyptian vultures foraging in anthropic landscapes (e.g., landfill sites and livestock farms) and exploiting small/medium-sized carrions. Brodifacoum was most prevalent (28.8%), followed by difenacoum (16.1%), flocoumafen (12.3%) and bromadiolone (7.3%). In SGAR-positive birds, the ΣSGAR (mean ± SE) was 7.52 ± 0.95 ng mL",2022-10-19,"Pilar Oliva-Vidal, José María Martínez, Inés S Sánchez-Barbudo, Pablo R Camarero, M Àngels Colomer, Antoni Margalida, Rafael Mateo",game,0
Sedentary behavior is associated with musculoskeletal pain in adolescents: A cross sectional study.,10.1016/j.bjpt.2022.100452,36257097,"High prevalence of back pain has been observed in adolescents. Sedentary behavior (SB) is considered a risk factor for musculoskeletal pain. The association between back pain and SB in the pediatric/adolescent population is not well established.
To investigate the association between SB and low back and neck pain in adolescents according to sex.
This is a cross-sectional study with children and adolescents aged 10-17 years, randomly recruited from public and private schools in Presidente Prudente, Brazil. All students enrolled in the selected schools were eligible to participate. SB was evaluated by adding the number of hours of use of screen devices, such as television, computer, video game, and smartphone/tablet. To assess neck and low back pain, the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used. Physical activity and socioeconomic status were assessed by the Baecke Questionnaire and the Brazilian Criteria for Economic Classification (ABEP), respectively. Odds ratio (OR) from Binary Logistic Regression in the unadjusted and adjusted model (physical activity, abdominal obesity, and socioeconomic status) showed the relationship between musculoskeletal pain and SB.
A total of 1011 adolescents (557 girls) with a mean ± standard deviation age of 13.2±2.4 years were included. Moderate (OR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.00, 3.23) and high (OR = 1.91; 95%CI: 1.02, 3.53) SB were associated with neck pain in girls. In boys, moderate SB [OR = 2.75; 95%CI: 1.31, 5.78) were associated with neck pain. Moderate (OR = 2.73; 95%CI: 1.45, 5.02) and high (OR = 2.49; 95%CI: 1.30, 4.76) SB were associated with low back pain only in girls.
Moderate and high SB were associated with neck pain in girls and boys, while moderate and high SB were associated with low back pain only in girls.",2022-10-19,"Lucas da Costa, Italo Ribeiro Lemes, William R Tebar, Crystian B Oliveira, Paulo H Guerra, José Luiz G Soidán, Jorge Mota, Diego G D Christofaro",game,1
Moderators of an intervention on emotional and behavioural problems: household- and school-level parental education.,10.1093/eurpub/ckac143,36256856,"Children of lower-educated parents and children in schools with a relatively high percentage of peers with lower-educated parents (lower parental education schools) are more likely to develop emotional and behavioural problems compared to children in higher-educated households and schools. Universal school-based preventive interventions, such as the Good Behaviour Game (GBG), are generally effective in preventing the development of emotional and behavioural problems, but information about potential moderators is limited. This study examined whether the effectiveness of the GBG in preventing emotional and behavioural problems differs between children in lower- and higher-educated households and schools.
Using a longitudinal multi-level randomized controlled trial design, 731 children (Mage=6.02 towards the end of kindergarten) from 31 mainstream schools (intervention arm: 21 schools, 484 children; control arm: 10 schools, 247 children) were followed annually from kindergarten to second grade (2004-2006). The GBG was implemented in first and second grades.
Overall, the GBG prevented the development of emotional and behavioural problems. However, for emotional problems, the GBG-effect was slightly more pronounced in higher parental education schools than in lower parental education schools (Bhigher parental education schools =-0.281, P <0.001; Blower parental education schools =-0.140, P = 0.016). No moderation by household-level parental education was found.
Studies into universal school-based preventive interventions, and in particular the GBG, should consider and incorporate school-level factors when studying the effectiveness of such interventions. More attention should be directed towards factors that may influence universal prevention effectiveness, particularly in lower parental education schools.",2022-10-19,"Nil Horoz, J Marieke Buil, Susanne Koot, Frank J van Lenthe, Tanja A J Houweling, Joost Oude Groeniger, Hans M Koot, Pol A C van Lier",game,0
Text Feature Adversarial Learning for Text Generation With Knowledge Transfer From GPT2.,10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3210975,36256717,"Text generation is a key component of many natural language tasks. Motivated by the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image generation, many text-specific GANs have been proposed. However, due to the discrete nature of text, these text GANs often use reinforcement learning (RL) or continuous relaxations to calculate gradients during learning, leading to high-variance or biased estimation. Furthermore, the existing text GANs often suffer from mode collapse (i.e., they have limited generative diversity). To tackle these problems, we propose a new text GAN model named text feature GAN (TFGAN), where adversarial learning is performed in a continuous text feature space. In the adversarial game, GPT2 provides the ""true"" features, while the generator of TFGAN learns from them. TFGAN is trained by maximum likelihood estimation on text space and adversarial learning on text feature space, effectively combining them into a single objective, while alleviating mode collapse. TFGAN achieves appealing performance in text generation tasks, and it can also be used as a flexible framework for learning text representations.",2022-10-19,"Hao Zhang, Yulai Cong, Zhengjue Wang, Lei Zhang, Miaoyun Zhao, Liqun Chen, Shijing Si, Ricardo Henao, Lawrence Carin",game,1

Game-play affects hamstring but not adductor muscle fibre mechanics in elite U20 basketball athletes.,10.1080/14763141.2022.2133006,36254725,"Muscle tendon unit fibre mechanics of hamstring and adductor strain injuries are not well studied, with factors such as fatigue promoted as risk factors in the absence of mechanistic evidence. In this study, musculoskeletal modelling was used to estimate fibre mechanics of four hamstring (biceps femoris long head, biceps femoris short head, semimembranosus and semitendinosus) and four adductor (adductor brevis, adductor longus, adductor magnus and gracilis) muscles during an anticipated cut task. The cut task was performed by 10 healthy elite male U20 basketball players both before and immediately after they played in one (of four) competitive basketball game. Biceps femoris long head produced significantly lower (p = 0.032) submaximal force post-game in the latter part of swing (30.7% to 35.0% of stride), though its peak force occurred later (37%) and remained unchanged. Semimembranosus produced significantly lower (p = 0.006) force post-game (32.9% to 44.9% of stride), which encompassed the instance of peak force (39%). Neither fibre velocity nor fibre length of the investigated muscles were significantly affected by game-play. These finding suggest that if fatigue is a factor in hamstring and adductor muscle strain injuries and is brought about by game-play, it is unlikely through the fibre mechanisms investigated in this study.",2022-10-19,"Riad Akhundov, David J Saxby, Laura E Diamond, Suzanne Snodgrass, Phil Clausen, Michael Drew, Katherine Dooley, Tania Pizzari, Ebonie Rio, Adrian Schultz, Luke Donnan, Tye McGann, Suzi Edwards",game,1

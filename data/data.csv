Refining the process: Safety net dental professionals' experiences with teledentistry implementation during the first year of COVID-19.,10.1111/jphd.12547,36257777,"Teledentistry helped dentistry adapt to pandemic-era challenges; little is known about dental professionals' teledentistry experiences during this time. This analysis sought to understand professionals' pandemic teledentistry experiences and expectations for the modality's future.
We conducted virtual individual interviews (n = 21) via Zoom to understand how federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) delivered oral care during the first year of the pandemic, including but not limited to the use of teledentistry. We independently coded each transcript, then identified themes and sub-themes.
We identified three major themes: (1) Logistical and equity considerations shaped teledentistry's adoption; (2) Team-based factors influenced implementation; and (3) Teledentistry's future is as-yet undetermined.
Experiences with teledentistry during the first year of COVID-19 varied substantially. Future directions should be more deliberate to counter the urgency of pandemic-style implementation and must address appropriate use, reimbursement guidance, patient and provider challenges, and customizability to each clinic's context.",2022-10-19,"Caroline D McLeod, Lisa J Heaton, Katherine Chung-Bridges, Sarah E Raskin",covid,1
Metabology: Analysis of metabolomics data using community ecology tools.,10.1016/j.aca.2022.340469,36257759,"Several areas such as microbiology, botany, and medicine use genetic information and computational tools to organize, classify and analyze data. However, only recently has it been possible to obtain the chemical ontology of metabolites computationally. The systematic classification of metabolites into classes opens the way for adapting methods that previously used genetic taxonomy to now accept chemical ontology. Community ecology tools are ideal for this adaptation as they have mature methods and enable exploratory data analysis with established statistical tools. This study introduces the Metabology approach, which transforms metabolites into an ecosystem where the metabolites (species) are related by chemical ontology. In the present work, we demonstrate the applicability of this new approach using publicly available data from a metabolomics study of human plasma that searched for prognostic markers of COVID-19, and in an untargeted metabolomics study carried out by our laboratory using Lasiodiplodia theobromae fungal pathogen supernatants.",2022-10-19,"Felipe Raposo Passos Mansoldo, Rafael Garrett, Veronica da Silva Cardoso, Marina Amaral Alves, Alane Beatriz Vermelho",covid,0
Novel approach based on GQD-PHB as anchoring platform for the development of SARS-CoV-2 electrochemical immunosensor.,10.1016/j.aca.2022.340442,36257733,"In the present work, we report an innovative approach for immunosensors construction. The experimental strategy is based on the anchoring of biological material at screen-printed carbon electrode (SPE) modified with electrodeposited Graphene Quantum Dots (GQD) and polyhydroxybutyric acid (PHB). It was used as functional substract basis for the recognition site receptor-binding domain (RBD) from coronavirus spike protein (SARS-CoV-2), for the detection of Anti-S antibodies (AbS). SEM images and EDS spectra suggest an interaction of the protein with GQD-PHB sites at the electrode surface. Differential pulse voltametric (DPV) measurements were performed before and after incubation, in presence of the target, shown a decrease in voltametric signal of an electrochemical probe ([Fe(CN)",2022-10-19,"Gustavo Martins, Jeferson L Gogola, Lucas H Budni, Maurício A Papi, Maritza A T Bom, Maria L T Budel, Emanuel M de Souza, Marcelo Müller-Santos, Breno C B Beirão, Craig E Banks, Luiz H Marcolino-Junior, Márcio F Bergamini",covid,0
Global Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Stroke Volumes and Cerebrovascular Events: One-Year Follow-up.,10.1212/WNL.0000000000201426,36257718,"Declines in stroke admission, intravenous thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy volumes were reported during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a paucity of data on the longer-term effect of the pandemic on stroke volumes over the course of a year and through the second wave of the pandemic. We sought to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volumes of stroke admissions, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), and mechanical thrombectomy over a one-year period at the onset of the pandemic (March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021) compared with the immediately preceding year (March 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020).
We conducted a longitudinal retrospective study across 6 continents, 56 countries, and 275 stroke centers. We collected volume data for COVID-19 admissions and 4 stroke metrics: ischemic stroke admissions, ICH admissions, intravenous thrombolysis treatments, and mechanical thrombectomy procedures. Diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes or classifications in stroke databases.
There were 148,895 stroke admissions in the one-year immediately before compared to 138,453 admissions during the one-year pandemic, representing a 7% decline (95% confidence interval [95% CI 7.1, 6.9]; p<0.0001). ICH volumes declined from 29,585 to 28,156 (4.8%, [5.1, 4.6]; p<0.0001) and IVT volume from 24,584 to 23,077 (6.1%, [6.4, 5.8]; p<0.0001). Larger declines were observed at high volume compared to low volume centers (all p<0.0001). There was no significant change in mechanical thrombectomy volumes (0.7%, [0.6,0.9]; p=0.49). Stroke was diagnosed in 1.3% [1.31,1.38] of 406,792 COVID-19 hospitalizations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was present in 2.9% ([2.82,2.97], 5,656/195,539) of all stroke hospitalizations.
There was a global decline and shift to lower volume centers of stroke admission volumes, ICH volumes, and IVT volumes during the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year. Mechanical thrombectomy volumes were preserved. These results suggest preservation in the stroke care of higher severity of disease through the first pandemic year.

"Knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of Jordanians towards the adopting and utilization of telemedicine: A national cross-sectional study.",10.2196/41499,36257609,"Due to the upsurge of COVID-19, nations are increasingly adopting telemedicine programs in anticipation of similar crises. Similar to all nations worldwide, Jordan is implementing efforts to adopt such technologies, yet it is far from complete.
This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of Jordanians towards telemedicine, to identify key factors predisposing to its use or hurdling its implementation.
We implemented a cross-sectional design using an online, self-administered questionnaire formulated on Google Forms and distributed through social media. Differences in knowledge and attitudes scores were examined by the independent sample t-test and ANOVA. A multivariate linear regression model was computed to assess predictors of awareness towards telemedicine.
A total of 1201 participants fully completed the questionnaire. Participants were characterized by a mean age of 36.3 ± 14.4 years and a male to female ratio of nearly 1:1. About 50% of our studied population being aware of telemedicine, while nearly 25% declared having observed it in action. Approximatively 68% of respondents were willing to use telemedicine. The majority of the sample portrayed favorable and positive views towards telemedicine. Higher educational degrees, living in urban districts, or have a higher perception of electronics usage ability are associated with higher knowledge and better attitudes towards telemedicine (all P <0.05). Multivariate linear regression demonstrates that perceived ability to use electronics is associated with positive attitudes (ß: 0.394; 95%CI: 0.224 - 0.563), while living in Southern Jordan predicts poor attitudes towards telemedicine (ß: -2.896; 95%CI: -4.873 - -0.919).
Jordanians portray favorable perceptions of telemedicine. Nonetheless, concerns with regards to privacy, medical errors, and capacity for accurate diagnoses are prevalent. Furthermore, Jordanians believe that integrating telemedicine within the healthcare system is not applicable due to limited resources.",2022-10-19,"Rand Murshidi, Muhammad Hammouri, Hana Taha, Razi Kitaneh, Mahmoud Alshneikat, Abdallah Al-Qawasmeh, Ahmad Al-Oleimat, Leen Al-Huneidy, Yazan Al-Huneidy, Abdallah Al-Ani",covid,0

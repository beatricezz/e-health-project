Deep Brain Stimulation during Pregnancy and Delivery: Review of Current Literature.,10.1055/s-0042-1753549,36261059,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established method in the treatment of not only Parkinson's disease motor complications but also dystonia and tremor, and there are data supporting the efficacy of DBS in epilepsy and some psychiatric problems. The alleviation of the neurologic problems may enable females of childbearing age to consider pregnancy because of being able to take care of their child. The aim of the study is to provide a review of the data available on the effect of DBS on the course of pregnancy and delivery in patients suffering from diseases amenable for DBS treatment (Parkinson's disease, dystonia, obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy). Although data available in the literature on pregnancy and childbirth in patients with an implanted active DBS system are limited to small case series and case reports, the number of younger patients implanted with DBS systems will potentially require more attention beyond specialized DBS centers. In emergency deliveries, general obstetricians and neurosurgeons should be provided with a protocol to prevent injuries to the implanted system with potentially devastating consequences for the patient.",2022-10-20,"Marek Baláž, Jiří Búřil, Jonáš Kunst, Dušan Hrabovský, Šimon Hajda, Jan Chrastina","((attention AND (disorder OR disorders)) OR ""ADHD"") AND (kid OR kids OR child OR children OR childhood) AND (treatment OR treatments OR therapy OR therapies) NOT (adult OR adults)",-

Management and outcomes in children with lupus nephritis in the developing countries.,10.1007/s00467-022-05769-x,36255555,"Lupus nephritis (LN) has variable prevalence, severity, and outcomes across the world.
This review compares the outcomes of childhood LN in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs) and aims to summarize long-term outcomes of pediatric LN from LMICs.
A systematic literature search, conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database in the last 30-years from January 1992, published in the English language, identified 113 studies including 52 from lower (n = 1336) and upper MICs (n = 3014).
Cohort studies or randomized controlled trials, of patients ≤ 18 years of age (or where such data can be separately extracted), with > 10 patients with clinically or histologically diagnosed LN and outcomes reported beyond 12 months were included.
Patients ≤ 18 years of age with clinically or histologically diagnosed LN; effect of an intervention was not measured.
Two authors independently extracted data. We separately analyzed studies from developed countries (high income countries; HIC) and developing countries (LMICs). Middle-income countries were further classified as lower and upper MICs. Meta-analyses of data were performed by calculating a pooled estimate utilizing the random-effects model. Test for heterogeneity was applied using I
Kidney remission was similar across MICs and HICs with 1-year pooled complete remission rates of 59% (95% CI 51-67%); one third of patients had kidney flares. The pooled 5-year survival free of stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5) was lower in MICs, especially in lower MICs compared to HICs (83% vs. 93%; P = 0.002). The pooled 5-year patient survival was significantly lower in MICs than HICs (85% vs. 94%; P < 0.001). In patients with class IV LN, the 5-and 10-year respective risk of CKD5 was 14% and 30% in MICs; corresponding risks in HICs were 8% and 17%. Long-term data from developing countries was limited. Sepsis (48.8%), kidney failure (14%), lupus activity (18.1%), and intracranial hemorrhage/infarct (5.4%) were chief causes of death; mortality due to complications of kidney failure was more common in lower MICs (25.6%) than HICs (6.4%).
The review is limited by heterogenous approach to diagnosis and management that has changed over the period spanning the review. World Bank classification based on income might not correlate with the standards of medical care. The overall quality of evidence is low since included studies were chiefly retrospective and single center.
Challenges in LMICs include limited access to pediatric nephrology care, dialysis, increased risk of infection-induced mortality, lack of frequent monitoring, and non-compliance due to cost of therapy. Attention to these issues might update the existing data and improve patient follow-up and outcomes.

The effects of rapid maxillary expansion on persistent pediatric snoring post-tonsillectomy.,10.1007/s11325-022-02724-w,36251209,"To investigate the short-term effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) on the quality of life of children who had persistent snoring post-adenotonsillectomy (AT).
The study included children with maxillary constriction aged 5 to 12 years, two or more years after AT whose parents/guardians reported that they still snored ≥ 5 nights per week. We enrolled children with sleep-disordered breathing, including children with primary snoring and children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). All patients underwent laryngeal nasofibroscopy and complete polysomnography. Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire (OSA-18), the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), Conners Abbreviated Scale (CAS), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were administered before and after RME.
Of 24 children enrolled, 13 had primary snoring and 11 had OSA. Overall OSA-18 scores were reduced in both groups (intragroup difference, p < 0.001). The PSQ total score, CAS, and ESS were significantly reduced in both groups (p < 0.001) In the evaluation of snoring, there was a reduction due to the treatment effect in both groups (p < 0.001). Daytime sleepiness and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders were also positively affected in both groups.
Our study demonstrated the potential benefit of RME in treating children with persistent snoring and transverse maxillary deficiency (TMD). RME can improve snoring and the QOL of children with refractory SDB after AT.

Coconut oil rubbing as an easy and safe way to improve symptoms in primary nocturnal enuresis: A randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial.,10.22038/AJP.2022.20346,36249458,"Enuresis is a common pediatric problem for which, no unique therapy has been suggested. The conventional therapy is effective, but fails in some cases. So, many parents try complementary medicine. Therefore, this study attempted to find if rubbing coconut oil is effective on improving enuresis.
This double-blinded randomized clinical was conducted on 120 children aged 6 to 14 years with mono symptomatic nocturnal enuresis, from 2018 to 2019 in Yazd, Iran. The drug and placebo groups applied 6 drops of the coconut and paraffin oil topically on the suprapubic, sacral and flanks areas one time per night, respectively. Urination pattern was daily recorded for a period of 8 weeks by parents, and after one year, they were asked for any improvement by phone call.
The mean frequency of enuresis at the first, second, fourth, and eighth week was lower in the intervention group (p<0.001); this difference between the groups remained after one year. Moreover, there was no side effect requiring any medical attention.
Rubbing coconut oil is effective on improving symptom of primary mono symptomatic enuresis if applied every night for 4 weeks on suprapubic, sacral and flanks areas. This may be related to anticholinergic effect of the oil but its persistent effect for longer time after the end of application period, needs to be investigated in other studies.",2022-10-18,"Abolfazl Dehghanpour, Monire Seyedhashemi, Ahmad Zare Bidaki, Zohre Mousavi, Majid Emtiazy, Mehrdad Shakiba","((attention AND (disorder OR disorders)) OR ""ADHD"") AND (kid OR kids OR child OR children OR childhood) AND (treatment OR treatments OR therapy OR therapies) NOT (adult OR adults)",-
"Tic Disorders, Anti-Tic Medications, and Risk of Atopy.",10.1002/mdc3.13506,36247912,"To clarify patterns of comorbid atopic disorders in children with tic disorders compared to controls, and to evaluate whether medications commonly used for treatment of tics and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are associated with differing risks of atopy.
Inflammatory mechanisms are increasingly recognized as playing a role in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. The association between tic disorders, ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and atopic disorders is uncertain.
We performed a retrospective cohort study using the global electronic health records database TriNetX. Using odds ratios, we compared the risk of atopy in children with tic disorder (n = 4508), ADHD (n = 83,569), and/or OCD (n = 1555) to controls (n = 758 290). To analyze the risk of developing atopy with use of different medications commonly prescribed to treat tics and ADHD, we performed a separate analysis including children with tic disorder, ADHD, and/or OCD who had initiated treatment with one of these medications. Binary logistic regression controlling for age and sex was used to calculate odds ratios.
Children with tic disorder, ADHD, or OCD were more likely than controls to have comorbid atopy. Children who had taken clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, or dexmethylphenidate were more likely to develop an atopic disorder than controls.
Our study suggests a link between atopic disorders and tic disorders, ADHD, and OCD.

The epidemiology and disease burden of congenital TORCH infections among hospitalized children in China: A national cross-sectional study.,10.1371/journal.pntd.0010861,36240247,"Congenital TORCH (Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), rubella virus (RV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV)) infections are associated with a variety of adverse prenatal and neonatal events, including miscarriage, malformations and developmental abnormalities, and they remain an issue that cannot be neglected in China. However, the current research focuses more on the general screening of TORCH in women of childbearing age, and the medical information of children hospitalized due to congenital and perinatal TORCH infections has not been described in detail. This study summarized and analyzed the epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, length of stay (LOS), and the disease burden of hospitalized children diagnosed with congenital TORCH infections in 27 children's hospitals in China.
Based on the face sheet of discharge medical records (FSMRs) of hospitalized children in 27 tertiary children's hospitals collected in the Futang Research Center of Pediatric Development and aggregated into FUTang Update medical REcords (FUTURE), we summarized and analyzed the epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, LOS, the disease burden (in US dollars, USD) and potential risk factors for hospitalized children diagnosed with congenital toxoplasmosis, congenital rubella syndrome, congenital cytomegalovirus infection, and congenital HSV in 27 children's hospitals in China from 2015 to 2020.
One hundred seventy-three patients aged 0-<1 year were hospitalized for congenital TORCH infections. Among infections with TORCH, hospitalization with congenital toxoplasmosis was the least common, with only five cases were reported (2.89%), while the LOS was the highest. The proportion of patients with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) was 15.61%, and 86% of children hospitalized with CRS had cardiovascular malformations, and the economic burden was the highest. Congenital CMV infection cases accounted for the largest proportion (76.30%). Overall, 5.20% of patients were infected with HSV, and the expense of hospitalization for congenital HSV infection was relatively low.
In the present study, the hospitalization proportion due to congenital TORCH infection was extremely low (17.56 per 100,000 neonates), indicating that China's congenital TORCH infection prevention and control policies remain effective. The lowest proportion of patients was hospitalized with congenital toxoplasmosis, while the LOS was the longest. The economic burden of CRS was heavy, and infants are recommended be vaccinated against RV in a timely manner. Congenital CMV infections accounted for the largest proportion of patients, suggesting that the disease burden of congenital CMV infection cannot be ignored, and the prevention of congenital CMV infection during pregnancy is still an important issue that needs to pay attention. The expense of hospitalization for congenital HSV infection was relatively low, while the disease burden increases significantly when patients develop complications. These data illustrate the importance of improving screening for congenital TORCH infections in the early diagnosis and treatment of neonatal patients.",2022-10-15,"Linlin Zhang, Xinyu Wang, Mengjia Liu, Guoshuang Feng, Yueping Zeng, Ran Wang, Zhengde Xie","((attention AND (disorder OR disorders)) OR ""ADHD"") AND (kid OR kids OR child OR children OR childhood) AND (treatment OR treatments OR therapy OR therapies) NOT (adult OR adults)",-
Insights on dental care management and prevention in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). What is new?,10.3389/froh.2022.998831,36238091,"Autistic subjects represent a severe concern to dentistry due to the considerable difficulty in managing their oral health, maintaining routine toothbrushing, and preventing dental and periodontal problems. The social and economic burden of managing dental care in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children is particularly cumbersome for families and public and private health expenditure, especially when children reach the dentist following a late diagnosis with evident oral health problems. An early diagnosis of ASD helps dentists better address these children's oral health. Unfortunately, insufficient attention is paid to the training and education of general pediatricians, dentists, and dental hygienists, allowing them to get to approach the different clinical aspects of ASD. Usually, children diagnosed with ASD are scheduled for dental appointments like their neurotypical peers, whereas their needs are typically complex and personalized. Scant attention is also devoted to these patients by commercial manufacturers of dental products and devices for oral hygiene and prevention of caries and periodontal diseases, leaving parents without the support and often failing when they address the oral health of autistic children. The difficulties of oral care do not derive simply from the behavior of ASD patients, as is commonly assumed, and therefore cannot be overcome solely by the patience and attention of parents and dentists. Genetics, dietary habits, sensory impairments, and cognition disorders are other causes contributing in various degrees to the impact on the mood and psychological reactions of autistic children towards dentists. How can we prevent teeth caries, periodontal disorders, and other oral health impairments by properly managing ASD children?

Sleep-Related Breathing Disorders in Children-Red Flags in Pediatric Care.,10.3390/jcm11195570,36233440,"In recent years, we have witnessed a growing interest in pediatric sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD). Although a Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) exists and was found reliable in screening SRBD in children, many of the children remain underdiagnosed. The aim of the present study was to define anamnestic and clinical findings that can serve as red flags indicating the presence of SRBD in children.
227 children aged 4-12 years old were evaluated with regard to the following parameters: (i) anamnestic variables (e.g., general state of health, oral habits, bruxism, esophageal reflux, sleep continuity, snoring); (ii) clinical parameters (e.g., oral mucosa, palate, tonsils, tongue, floor of the mouth, angle classification, gingival health, caries risk) and (iii) presence of SRBD (through the PSQ).
Significant differences between children with and without SRBD were observed regarding continuous sleep, developmental delay, mouth breathing, and snoring. Taking medications for ADHD increased the odds of SRBD in children by over seven times, non-continuous sleep increased the odds of SRBD by six times, mouth breathing increased the odds by almost five times, and snoring increased the odds by over three times.
Child caregivers from various fields (dentists, orthodontists, pediatric physicians, school nurses) should actively inquire about disturbed sleep, medications for ADHD, snoring, and mouth breathing among their young patients. Initial screening through a few simple questions may help raise red flags that can assist in the early detection of SRBD in children and lead to proper diagnosis and treatment.",2022-10-15,"Sigalit Blumer, Ilana Eli, Shani Kaminsky-Kurtz, Yarden Shreiber-Fridman, Eran Dolev, Alona Emodi-Perlman","((attention AND (disorder OR disorders)) OR ""ADHD"") AND (kid OR kids OR child OR children OR childhood) AND (treatment OR treatments OR therapy OR therapies) NOT (adult OR adults)",-
Nasal Microbiome and Its Interaction with the Host in Childhood Asthma.,10.3390/cells11193155,36231116,"Childhood asthma is a major chronic non-communicable disease in infants and children, often triggered by respiratory tract infections. The nasal cavity is a reservoir for a broad variety of commensal microbes and potential pathogens associated with respiratory illnesses including asthma. A healthy nasal microenvironment has protective effects against respiratory tract infections. The first microbial colonisation in the nasal region is initiated immediately after birth. Subsequently, colonisation by nasal microbiota during infancy plays important roles in rapidly establishing immune homeostasis and the development and maturation of the immune system. Dysbiosis of microbiota residing in the mucosal surfaces, such as the nasopharynx and guts, triggers immune modulation, severe infection, and exacerbation events. Nasal microbiome dysbiosis is related to the onset of symptomatic infections. Dynamic interactions between viral infections and the nasal microbiota in early life affect the later development of respiratory infections. In this review, we summarise the existing findings related to nasal microbiota colonisation, dynamic variations, and host-microbiome interactions in childhood health and respiratory illness with a particular examination of asthma. We also discuss our current understanding of biases produced by environmental factors and technical concerns, the importance of standardised research methods, and microbiome modification for the prevention or treatment of childhood asthma.

Neuroprotection in late life attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A review of pharmacotherapy and phenotype across the lifespan.,10.3389/fnhum.2022.938501,36226261,"For decades, psychostimulants have been the gold standard pharmaceutical treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the United States, an astounding 9% of all boys and 4% of girls will be prescribed stimulant drugs at some point during their childhood. Recent meta-analyses have revealed that individuals with ADHD have reduced brain volume loss later in life (>60 y.o.) compared to the normal aging brain, which suggests that either ADHD or its treatment may be neuroprotective. Crucially, these neuroprotective effects were significant in brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala) where severe volume loss is linked to cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Historically, the ADHD diagnosis and its pharmacotherapy came about nearly simultaneously, making it difficult to evaluate their effects in isolation. Certain evidence suggests that psychostimulants may normalize structural brain changes typically observed in the ADHD brain. If ADHD itself is neuroprotective, perhaps exercising the brain, then psychostimulants may not be recommended across the lifespan. Alternatively, if stimulant drugs are neuroprotective, then this class of medications may warrant further investigation for their therapeutic effects. Here, we take a bottom-up holistic approach to review the psychopharmacology of ADHD in the context of recent models of attention. We suggest that future studies are greatly needed to better appreciate the interactions amongst an ADHD diagnosis, stimulant treatment across the lifespan, and structure-function alterations in the aging brain.",2022-10-14,"Cintya Nirvana Dutta, Leonardo Christov-Moore, Hernando Ombao, Pamela K Douglas","((attention AND (disorder OR disorders)) OR ""ADHD"") AND (kid OR kids OR child OR children OR childhood) AND (treatment OR treatments OR therapy OR therapies) NOT (adult OR adults)",-
Behavioral sleep medicine-The need for harmonization of clinical best practice outcome measures in children and adolescents with intellectual or developmental disabilities and restless sleep.,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1003019,36226108,"In behavioral medicine, sleep disorders, insomnia in particular, may be considered comorbidities and precipitating factors to intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD). Nevertheless, sleep alterations have often been neglected in favor of daytime features and symptoms, albeit simple behavioral nighttime observations may disclose hypermotor features that characterize restless sleep. The root of most hypermotor restlessness is linked to central iron deficiency. The latter is often exacerbated by vitamin D deficiency (VDD), which interferes with both dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanisms. In this way, an imbalance affecting daytime behavior and mood is created. Several sleep-related motor disorders such as bruxism, periodic and aperiodic leg movements, Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), and Restless Sleep Disorder (RSD) are commonly seen in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However, they are rarely diagnosed and often overlooked in affected children and adolescents. As a result, not only are these disorders not adequately addressed therapeutically, but their symptoms may be worsened by the side-effects of drugs used to contain disruptive daytime behavior, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. In children with IDDs, obesity, inactivity and metabolic effects of antipsychotics often lead to Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), which is currently understood as an inflammatory state leading to ""hyperactive"" lethargy and further alterations of the hypoxic chain and vitamin D levels. Endorsing simple routine blood tests, including inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, ferritin, transferrin, and vitamin D levels, may favorably complement caregiver observations and ambulatory sleep recordings, leading to a sleep disorder diagnosis and consequent therapy. In fact, the treatment of SDB, RLS, and RSD has been copiously demonstrated to favorably impact vigilance, behavior, social competence, and academic skills in healthy and, to a greater extent, in IDD children.

Treatment biomarkers for ADHD: Taking stock and moving forward.,10.1038/s41398-022-02207-2,36224169,"The development of treatment biomarkers for psychiatric disorders has been challenging, particularly for heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Promising findings are also rarely translated into clinical practice, especially with regard to treatment decisions and development of novel treatments. Despite this slow progress, the available neuroimaging, electrophysiological (EEG) and genetic literature provides a solid foundation for biomarker discovery. This article gives an updated review of promising treatment biomarkers for ADHD which may enhance personalized medicine and novel treatment development. The available literature points to promising pre-treatment profiles predicting efficacy of various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD. These candidate predictive biomarkers, particularly those based on low-cost and non-invasive EEG assessments, show promise for the future stratification of patients to specific treatments. Studies with repeated biomarker assessments further show that different treatments produce distinct changes in brain profiles, which track treatment-related clinical improvements. These candidate monitoring/response biomarkers may aid future monitoring of treatment effects and point to mechanistic targets for novel treatments, such as neurotherapies. Nevertheless, existing research does not support any immediate clinical applications of treatment biomarkers for ADHD. Key barriers are the paucity of replications and external validations, the use of small and homogeneous samples of predominantly White children, and practical limitations, including the cost and technical requirements of biomarker assessments and their unknown feasibility and acceptability for people with ADHD. We conclude with a discussion of future directions and methodological changes to promote clinical translation and enhance personalized treatment decisions for diverse groups of individuals with ADHD.",2022-10-13,"Giorgia Michelini, Luke J Norman, Philip Shaw, Sandra K Loo","((attention AND (disorder OR disorders)) OR ""ADHD"") AND (kid OR kids OR child OR children OR childhood) AND (treatment OR treatments OR therapy OR therapies) NOT (adult OR adults)",-
Adaptive Behavior in Young Autistic Children: Associations with Irritability and ADHD Symptoms.,10.1007/s10803-022-05753-2,36222990,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms affect 40-60% of autistic children and have been linked to differences in adaptive behavior. It is unclear whether adaptive behavior in autistic youth is directly impacted by co-occurring ADHD symptoms or by another associated feature of both autism and ADHD, such as increased irritability. The current study examined relationships between irritability, ADHD symptoms, and adaptive behavior in 3- to 7-year-old autistic children. Results suggest that, after adjusting for co-occurring ADHD symptoms, higher levels of irritability are associated with differences in social adaptive behavior specifically. Understanding relationships between irritability, ADHD, and adaptive behavior in autistic children is critical because measures of adaptive behavior, such as the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Functioning, are often used as a proxy for global functioning, as well as for developing intervention plans and measuring outcomes as primary endpoints in clinical trials.",2022-10-13,"Kimberly L H Carpenter, Naomi O Davis, Marina Spanos, Maura Sabatos-DeVito, Rachel Aiello, Grace T Baranek, Scott N Compton, Helen L Egger, Lauren Franz, Soo-Jeong Kim, Bryan H King, Alexander Kolevzon, Christopher J McDougle, Kevin Sanders, Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele, Linmarie Sikich, Scott H Kollins, Geraldine Dawson","((attention AND (disorder OR disorders)) OR ""ADHD"") AND (kid OR kids OR child OR children OR childhood) AND (treatment OR treatments OR therapy OR therapies) NOT (adult OR adults)",-

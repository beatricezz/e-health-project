Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides in the blood of obligate and facultative european avian scavengers.,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120385,36257565,"The widespread use of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) and their high persistence in animal tissues has led to these compounds becoming ubiquitous in rodent-predator-scavenger food webs. Exposure to SGARs has usually been investigated in wildlife species found dead, and despite growing evidence of the potential risk of secondary poisoning of predators and scavengers, the current worldwide exposure of free-living scavenging birds to SGARs remains scarcely investigated. We present the first active monitoring of blood SGAR concentrations and prevalence in the four European obligate (i.e., vultures) and facultative (red and black kites) avian scavengers in NE Spain. We analysed 261 birds and detected SGARs in 39.1% (n = 102) of individuals. Both SGAR prevalence and concentrations (ΣSGARs) were related to the age and foraging behaviour of the species studied. Black kites showed the highest prevalence (100%), followed by red kites (66.7%), Egyptian (64.2%), bearded (20.9%), griffon (16.9%) and cinereous (6.3%) vultures. Overall, both the prevalence and average ΣSGARs were higher in non-nestlings than nestlings, and in species such as kites and Egyptian vultures foraging in anthropic landscapes (e.g., landfill sites and livestock farms) and exploiting small/medium-sized carrions. Brodifacoum was most prevalent (28.8%), followed by difenacoum (16.1%), flocoumafen (12.3%) and bromadiolone (7.3%). In SGAR-positive birds, the ΣSGAR (mean ± SE) was 7.52 ± 0.95 ng mL",2022-10-19,"Pilar Oliva-Vidal, José María Martínez, Inés S Sánchez-Barbudo, Pablo R Camarero, M Àngels Colomer, Antoni Margalida, Rafael Mateo",game,0
Sedentary behavior is associated with musculoskeletal pain in adolescents: A cross sectional study.,10.1016/j.bjpt.2022.100452,36257097,"High prevalence of back pain has been observed in adolescents. Sedentary behavior (SB) is considered a risk factor for musculoskeletal pain. The association between back pain and SB in the pediatric/adolescent population is not well established.
To investigate the association between SB and low back and neck pain in adolescents according to sex.
This is a cross-sectional study with children and adolescents aged 10-17 years, randomly recruited from public and private schools in Presidente Prudente, Brazil. All students enrolled in the selected schools were eligible to participate. SB was evaluated by adding the number of hours of use of screen devices, such as television, computer, video game, and smartphone/tablet. To assess neck and low back pain, the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire was used. Physical activity and socioeconomic status were assessed by the Baecke Questionnaire and the Brazilian Criteria for Economic Classification (ABEP), respectively. Odds ratio (OR) from Binary Logistic Regression in the unadjusted and adjusted model (physical activity, abdominal obesity, and socioeconomic status) showed the relationship between musculoskeletal pain and SB.
A total of 1011 adolescents (557 girls) with a mean ± standard deviation age of 13.2±2.4 years were included. Moderate (OR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.00, 3.23) and high (OR = 1.91; 95%CI: 1.02, 3.53) SB were associated with neck pain in girls. In boys, moderate SB [OR = 2.75; 95%CI: 1.31, 5.78) were associated with neck pain. Moderate (OR = 2.73; 95%CI: 1.45, 5.02) and high (OR = 2.49; 95%CI: 1.30, 4.76) SB were associated with low back pain only in girls.

Moderators of an intervention on emotional and behavioural problems: household- and school-level parental education.,10.1093/eurpub/ckac143,36256856,"Children of lower-educated parents and children in schools with a relatively high percentage of peers with lower-educated parents (lower parental education schools) are more likely to develop emotional and behavioural problems compared to children in higher-educated households and schools. Universal school-based preventive interventions, such as the Good Behaviour Game (GBG), are generally effective in preventing the development of emotional and behavioural problems, but information about potential moderators is limited. This study examined whether the effectiveness of the GBG in preventing emotional and behavioural problems differs between children in lower- and higher-educated households and schools.
Using a longitudinal multi-level randomized controlled trial design, 731 children (Mage=6.02 towards the end of kindergarten) from 31 mainstream schools (intervention arm: 21 schools, 484 children; control arm: 10 schools, 247 children) were followed annually from kindergarten to second grade (2004-2006). The GBG was implemented in first and second grades.
Overall, the GBG prevented the development of emotional and behavioural problems. However, for emotional problems, the GBG-effect was slightly more pronounced in higher parental education schools than in lower parental education schools (Bhigher parental education schools =-0.281, P <0.001; Blower parental education schools =-0.140, P = 0.016). No moderation by household-level parental education was found.
Studies into universal school-based preventive interventions, and in particular the GBG, should consider and incorporate school-level factors when studying the effectiveness of such interventions. More attention should be directed towards factors that may influence universal prevention effectiveness, particularly in lower parental education schools.",2022-10-19,"Nil Horoz, J Marieke Buil, Susanne Koot, Frank J van Lenthe, Tanja A J Houweling, Joost Oude Groeniger, Hans M Koot, Pol A C van Lier",game,0
Text Feature Adversarial Learning for Text Generation With Knowledge Transfer From GPT2.,10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3210975,36256717,"Text generation is a key component of many natural language tasks. Motivated by the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image generation, many text-specific GANs have been proposed. However, due to the discrete nature of text, these text GANs often use reinforcement learning (RL) or continuous relaxations to calculate gradients during learning, leading to high-variance or biased estimation. Furthermore, the existing text GANs often suffer from mode collapse (i.e., they have limited generative diversity). To tackle these problems, we propose a new text GAN model named text feature GAN (TFGAN), where adversarial learning is performed in a continuous text feature space. In the adversarial game, GPT2 provides the ""true"" features, while the generator of TFGAN learns from them. TFGAN is trained by maximum likelihood estimation on text space and adversarial learning on text feature space, effectively combining them into a single objective, while alleviating mode collapse. TFGAN achieves appealing performance in text generation tasks, and it can also be used as a flexible framework for learning text representations.",2022-10-19,"Hao Zhang, Yulai Cong, Zhengjue Wang, Lei Zhang, Miaoyun Zhao, Liqun Chen, Shijing Si, Ricardo Henao, Lawrence Carin",game,0

Game-play affects hamstring but not adductor muscle fibre mechanics in elite U20 basketball athletes.,10.1080/14763141.2022.2133006,36254725,"Muscle tendon unit fibre mechanics of hamstring and adductor strain injuries are not well studied, with factors such as fatigue promoted as risk factors in the absence of mechanistic evidence. In this study, musculoskeletal modelling was used to estimate fibre mechanics of four hamstring (biceps femoris long head, biceps femoris short head, semimembranosus and semitendinosus) and four adductor (adductor brevis, adductor longus, adductor magnus and gracilis) muscles during an anticipated cut task. The cut task was performed by 10 healthy elite male U20 basketball players both before and immediately after they played in one (of four) competitive basketball game. Biceps femoris long head produced significantly lower (p = 0.032) submaximal force post-game in the latter part of swing (30.7% to 35.0% of stride), though its peak force occurred later (37%) and remained unchanged. Semimembranosus produced significantly lower (p = 0.006) force post-game (32.9% to 44.9% of stride), which encompassed the instance of peak force (39%). Neither fibre velocity nor fibre length of the investigated muscles were significantly affected by game-play. These finding suggest that if fatigue is a factor in hamstring and adductor muscle strain injuries and is brought about by game-play, it is unlikely through the fibre mechanisms investigated in this study.",2022-10-19,"Riad Akhundov, David J Saxby, Laura E Diamond, Suzanne Snodgrass, Phil Clausen, Michael Drew, Katherine Dooley, Tania Pizzari, Ebonie Rio, Adrian Schultz, Luke Donnan, Tye McGann, Suzi Edwards",game,0
Interpersonal relationships modulate subjective ratings and electrophysiological responses of moral evaluations.,10.3758/s13415-022-01041-9,36253608,"This study explored how interpersonal relationships modulate moral evaluations in moral dilemmas. Participants rated moral acceptability in response to altruistic (prescriptive) and selfish (proscriptive) behavior conducted by allocators (i.e., a friend or stranger), toward the participants themselves or another stranger in a modified Dictator Game (Experiments 1 and 2). Event-related potential (ERP) data were recorded as participants observed the allocators' behavior (Experiment 2). Moral acceptability ratings showed that when the allocator was a friend, participants evaluated the friend's altruistic and selfish behavior toward another stranger as being less morally acceptable than when their friend showed the respective behavior toward the participants themselves. The ERP results showed that participants exhibited more negative medial frontal negativity (MFN) amplitude whether observing a friend's altruistic or selfish behavior toward a stranger (vs. participant oneself), indicating that friends' altruistic and selfish behaviors toward strangers (vs. participants) were processed as being less acceptable at the earlier and semi-automatic processing stage in brains. However, this effect did not emerge when the allocator was a stranger in subjective ratings and MFN results. In the later-occurring P3 component, no interpersonal relationship modulation occurred in moral evaluations. These findings suggest that interpersonal relationships affect moral evaluations from the second-party perspective.",2022-10-18,"Jin Li, Mei Li, Yu Sun, Wei Fan, Yiping Zhong",game,0

Analysis of potential hydration opportunities during future football tournaments based on data from the 2018 FIFA World Cup.,10.1080/24733938.2022.2137574,36252322,"The World Cup is traditionally held during the hot summer months which requires playing in oppressive thermal conditions. Therefore, teams should follow heat strain mitigation strategies, such as acclimatization, pre-exercise cooling, and optimal fluid ingestion. Even though the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is being moved to the autumn to reduce environmental stress, many challenges will remain. The objective of this analysis was to assess and visually communicate match-based World Cup player hydration opportunities and behaviors. Broadcast recordings of the 2018 World Cup (June-July) were analyzed. Descriptive data were reported for match duration, the number, type, and duration of breaks, and player-initiated hydration moments, as well as data reporting environmental conditions using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), with matches categorized as ""no thermal stress"" and ""thermal heat stress."" The median number and interquartile range of total match breaks were 7 [5-8] during official breaks, with a duration of 42 [23-72] seconds. There were 2 [1-3] player-initiated hydration moments per game, with a duration of 77 [55 to 100] seconds. On top of the 29% (#126) of breaks in which drinking occurred, an additional 26% (#33) of self-initiated drinking was registered with a duration of 7 [4-28] seconds without an official break. There was no significant difference (P=0.22) in self-initiated hydration between matches played under the two thermal conditions. Relative percentages showed suboptimal use of substitution (14%) and VAR (38%) breaks vs. injury breaks (75%).

Game-Based Virtual Reality System for Upper Limb Rehabilitation After Stroke in a Clinical Environment: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,10.1089/g4h.2022.0086,36252097,"The use of virtual reality (VR) for stroke rehabilitation has been implemented during the last decade. At present, most studies still focus on the effects of VR on upper limb rehabilitation, and few studies have explored VR games, VR system designs, and rehabilitation modes for upper limb rehabilitation. This study aims to (1) evaluate the rehabilitation effect of stroke patients using a game-based VR upper limb rehabilitation system in clinical settings; (2) investigate the impact of custom and commercial VR games on patients in clinical settings; and (3) review VR upper limb rehabilitation modes. The PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched, and related literature published through December 2021 was included. A total of 4700 articles were retrieved according to the search strategy. We identified 24 studies, including 793 patients. We conducted a systematic search for randomized controlled trials with adult stroke patients to analyze the effect of game-based VR upper limb rehabilitation systems. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effects of upper limb function, hand dexterity, daily living ability, and cognitive function between the experimental group (EG, using VR for upper limb rehabilitation) and control group (CG, receiving conventional rehabilitation, including physical therapy and occupational therapy). We also conducted an analysis of both custom and commercial games. The results of the meta-analysis proved that game-based VR upper limb rehabilitation therapy for cerebral apoplexy is an effective method of rehabilitation in clinical settings and is more effective than traditional rehabilitation in improving patients' upper limb function and hand mobility. Custom games heal better than commercial games. This study only includes nonimmersive device rehabilitation modes due to research constraints and classified them into four categories. The mode of VR games combined with rehabilitation instruments may solve the problem that patients with severe upper limb dysfunction cannot operate games. Whether the use of immersive VR devices and the fun of games will affect patients' rehabilitation motivation and effect is the direction of future research.",2022-10-18,"Le Wang, Jean-Lon Chen, Alice M K Wong, Kuei-Chia Liang, Kevin C Tseng",game,0

Evolutionary game analysis of polluting NIMBY facilities reconstruction based on public participation behavior.,10.1371/journal.pone.0276272,36251726,"With the advancement of urbanization and the expansion of urban areas, NIMBY (not in my back yard) environmental public facilities are increasing day by day. It is meaningful to incorporate public participation into the regulatory process for the existing pollution NIMBY facility enterprises. Through the establishment of the tripartite game model of local government, polluting NIMBY facility enterprises and the public, the evolution stability analysis and simulation analysis of their strategies are carried out, and the Pareto optimal solution is obtained. The results show that: The strategy choices of the players of the three-party game are different under different stability conditions. The system can be broken out of the bad state by increasing government punishment, local governments strictly controlling the potential profits, the potential losses of polluting enterprises not rebuilding, the long-term public benefits and reducing the cost of public participation, etc., and the three-party common governance mode can be formed. The strategy evolution speed of a player in a three-party game is affected by his own strategy choice proportion and the strategy choice proportion of the other two players, but no matter how the strategy choice proportion of the player in a three-party game changes, it will not change the final game result. On the basis of comprehensive analysis, a series of relevant suggestions are put forward from the three aspects of government, enterprises and the public, so as to provide certain reference for the design of the public participation system of polluting NIMBY facilities.",2022-10-18,"Hui Zhao, Mengran Zhang, Weihan Wang",game,1
Assessing Team Effectiveness by How Players Structure Their Search in a First-Person Multiplayer Video Game.,10.1111/cogs.13204,36251464,"People working as a team can achieve more than when working alone due to a team's ability to parallelize the completion of tasks. In collaborative search tasks, this necessitates the formation of effective division of labor strategies to minimize redundancies in search. For such strategies to be developed, team members need to perceive the task's relevant components and how they evolve over time, as well as an understanding of what others will do so that they can structure their own behavior to contribute to the team's goal. This study explored whether the capacity for team members to coordinate effectively can be related to how participants structure their search behaviors in an online multiplayer collaborative search task. Our results demonstrated that the structure of search behavior, quantified using detrended fluctuation analysis, was sensitive to contextual factors that limit a participant's ability to gather information. Further, increases in the persistence of movement fluctuations during search behavior were found as teams developed more effective coordinative strategies and were associated with better task performance.",2022-10-18,"Patrick Nalepka, Matthew Prants, Hamish Stening, James Simpson, Rachel W Kallen, Mark Dras, Erik D Reichle, Simon G Hosking, Christopher Best, Michael J Richardson",game,0
The effect of justified video game violence on aggressive behavior and moderated immersion: An experimental approach.,10.1002/ab.22054,36251004,"The effect of violent video games on aggressive behavior is an important topic in the field of game research. Recently, growing evidence suggests that justified game violence decreases feelings of guilt caused by in-game immoral behavior. However, little is known about the impact on aggressive behavior, and whether other factors moderate this effect. In a two-factor experiment, we tested the impact of justification of video game violence on aggressive behavior, and whether this effect would be enhanced by game immersion. Pilot experiment 1 (N = 60) and pilot experiment 2 (N = 40) demonstrated that the justification of violence and game immersion was successfully controlled by avatar and graphics quality. In the Main experiment, 123 participants played one of four conditions of a video game (2 [justification: justified vs. unjustified violence] × 2 [immersion: high vs. low immersion]) and it was found that participants who played in the justified violence condition reported greater aggressive behavior than those in the unjustified violence condition. In addition, participants who played in high immersion reported greater aggressive behavior than those in low immersion. However, game immersion did not moderate the effects of justified violence. This unexpected effect is likely due to participants' distancing themselves from and identifying less with their violent avatars.",2022-10-18,"Shuai Chen, Bo Mao, Yanling Liu",game,0
Improved Combination Weighted Prediction Model of Aquifer Water Abundance Based on a Cloud Model.,10.1021/acsomega.2c04162,36249369,"The sandstone aquifer is an important underground water storage space, and the study of its water abundance is of great significance to ensure the safety of underground engineering and to explore the occurrence mechanism of groundwater sources. Based on the correlation between geological characteristics and aquifer water abundance, this paper proposed an aquifer water abundance prediction model based on a cloud model that improved combination weighting. The model took the roof sandstone aquifer of the Qingshuiying Coalfield as an example and selected five basic geological indicators that are closely related to the water-rich influence degree of the aquifer as evaluation indicators. The model was based on the idea of game theory, combined the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the entropy weight method, and introduced the cloud model evaluation method. The establishment of the model was based on the idea of game theory, combining the AHP and the entropy weight method and introducing the cloud model evaluation method. The results show that most of the study areas are located in weak or relatively weak water abundance areas; relatively strong water abundance areas are mainly distributed in the central, western, and southeastern parts of the study; strong water abundance areas are scattered in parts of the northeast, southwest, and southeast. The unit water inflow data of the actual pumping test is consistent with the water-rich prediction partition, which proves the accuracy and scientificity of the method. The model provides a new idea for the study of groundwater geology and a new method for predicting the water abundance of the roof aquifer in coal mines.",2022-10-18,"Wenju Cheng, Fangying Dong, Ruqian Tang, Huiyong Yin, Longqing Shi, Yutao Zhai, Xin Li",game,0
Condition-dependent trade-offs maintain honest signalling.,10.1098/rsos.220335,36249330,"How and why animals and humans signal reliably is a key issue in biology and social sciences that needs to be understood to explain the evolution of communication. In situations in which the receiver needs to differentiate between low- and high-quality signallers, once a ruling paradigm, the Handicap Principle has claimed that honest signals have to be costly to produce. Subsequent game theoretical models, however, highlighted that honest signals are not necessarily costly. Honesty is maintained by the potential cost of cheating: by the difference in the marginal benefit to marginal cost for low versus high-quality signallers; i.e. by differential trade-offs. Owing to the difficulties of manipulating signal costs and benefits, there is lack of empirical tests of these predictions. We present the results of a laboratory decision-making experiment with human participants to test the role of equilibrium signal cost and signalling trade-offs for the development of honest communication. We found that the trade-off manipulation had a much higher influence on the reliability of communication than the manipulation of the equilibrium cost of signal.

Assessing young children's national identity through human-computer interaction: A game-based assessment task.,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.956570,36248538,"As a way of human-computer interaction, game-based assessment is more suitable for young children because it is situational, interesting, and effective. National identity is an important factor affecting the overall development of young children and the future development of a country, which has attracted extensive attention from researchers. Nevertheless, the assessment of young children's national identity is still based on traditional evaluation, including questionnaires and interviews, which have the limitations of being inaccurate, dull, and time-consuming. To understand the characteristics of children's national identity, it is necessary to use scientific and interactive assessment methods. The present study investigated whether the game-based assessment we developed specifically would be an appropriate tool to measure young children's national identity. The results show that the game-based assessment had good item discrimination. Exploratory factor analysis demonstrated the game covered three aspects: national cognition mastery, national emotion engagement, and national behavior tendency. The confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the model with three factors fit the data well. The internal consistency, the split-half reliability, and the test-retest reliability meet standards.

Surgeon's comfort: The ergonomics of a robotic exoscope using a head-mounted display.,10.1016/j.bas.2021.100855,36248127,"Conventional microscopes have certain limitations in terms of posture and ergonomics. Monitor-based exoscopes could solve this problem and thereby lead to less work-related sick leave for surgeons.

34 neurosurgeons participated in a workshop on the exoscope, which features a head-mounted display and a head gesture-triggered control panel. After completion of a custom-made 10-step microsurgical exercise, image quality and comfort were assessed using a questionnaire. The participants' posture during the exercise was analyzed using a video motion analysis software.
34 participants (median neurosurgical experience: 6 years) were included. The median time to complete the exercise was 12 ​min [IqR 9.4, 15.0].

Twenty-four young soccer players (age: 15.9 ± 1.0 years) played 2vs2, 3vs3, and 4vs4 SSGs consisting of four bouts (with two-minute passive rest periods between bouts) under two different playing conditions: MF+SSGs and SSGs. The heart rate, total distance covered, and technical performance of each player were monitored during all SSGs, and the rating of perceived exertion, visual analogue scale, and Rating Scale Mental Effort values were determined after each bout. The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) and Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) were also determined at the end of each SSG. The results demonstrated that all MF+SSGs induced higher psychophysiological responses (p ≤ 0.05) than SSGs, except regarding the PACES responses. By contrast, the SSGs group covered a greater total distance (p ≤ 0.05) than the MF+SSGs group. During SSGs, the players' technical performances (in terms of lost balls and unsuccessful passes) were negatively affected after MF (p ≤ 0.05). The results of this study indicate that both PACES scores and mood responses were negatively affected after the MF intervention. Coaches could use the MF intervention before SSGs to improve soccer-specific technical and decision-making performances in young soccer players.",2022-10-18,"Yusuf Soylu, Fikret Ramazanoglu, Ersan Arslan, Filipe Manuel Clemente",game,0

Do conditioning focused various-sided training games prepare elite youth male soccer players for the demands of competition?,10.5114/biolsport.2022.109454,36247949,"Relative metrics (i.e. distance covered per minute of match time) are regularly used to quantify soccer player movement demands. However, limited literature is available concerning the peak player demands during training. This study aimed to compare the relative and peak demands of conditioning-focused various-sided training games (VSG) to competition matches in elite youth male soccer players according to playing position. Data from twenty-nine competition matches (national) and twenty-two VSGs (small, medium, and large) were collected for twenty-three elite under-17 soccer players using 15-Hz portable global positioning system tracking devices (GPSports, Canberra, Australia). Relative player movements were reported as total distance (TD) and high-speed running distance (HSRD) (> 5.0 m/s) per minute of total playing time. Peak player movements were calculated using a 1-minute rolling epoch length, reported as the maximum TD and HSRD. Linear mixed models demonstrated interactions between VSG type and player position for relative TD (",2022-10-18,"Michael G Sydney, Martin Wollin, Dale W Chapman, Nick Ball, Jocelyn K Mara",game,0
Small-sided games in volleyball: A systematic review of the state of the art.,10.5114/biolsport.2022.109960,36247946,"Studies on small-sided games (SSG) in team sports have increased in recent decades. However, the literature concerning this training strategy in volleyball is sparse. This study aims to summarize and analyse the scientific evidence on SSG in volleyball. For this purpose, electronic searches were conducted in August 2021 in PubMed, Scielo, ScienceDirect, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases. As result, a total of 22 studies (3 cross-sectional, 7 quasi-experimental, and 12 randomized controlled trial) that used SSG in volleyball were included in the qualitative synthesis after applying the eligibility criteria. Despite the few studies available for each outcome, our results suggest that the SSG can be used as a methodological resource for volleyball teaching and training of educational, recreational, and high-performance character. In conclusion, the use of SSG in volleyball is a pedagogical and training alternative with positive effects on populations with different levels of training (school and university students, recreational adult players, and athletes) considering instructional approaches, sport knowledge, participation in Physical Education classes, health markers, physical fitness, and physiological, psychological, and tactical-technical variables. However, more studies need to be carried out using SSG in volleyball in different contexts, with different manipulations and variables.",2022-10-18,"Henrique de Oliveira Castro, Lorenzo Laporta, Ricardo Franco Lima, Filipe Manuel Clemente, José Afonso, Samuel da Silva Aguiar, Alexandre Lima de Araújo Ribeiro, Gustavo De Conti Teixeira Costa",game,0
International matches elicit stable mechanical workload in high-level female ice hockey.,10.5114/biolsport.2022.109455,36247938,"This study aimed to quantify in- and between-match characteristics and mechanical workload variations elicited by a congested schedule in high-level female ice hockey. Six players were monitored during four international pre-season exhibition matches against the same opponent. Two different methods (Player Load and Accel'Rate) were used to assess specific mechanical workload. Number of shifts and effective playing time per shift were significantly higher for period 2 (p = 0.03 for both). Mechanical workload intensity (i.e., relative and peak workload) showed a significant (p ≤ 0.05) decrease from period 1 to period 2 and period 3 (",2022-10-18,"Jérôme Perez, Franck Brocherie, Antoine Couturier, Gaël Guilhem",game,0
Evaluating expert-based habitat suitability information of terrestrial mammals with GPS-tracking data.,10.1111/geb.13523,36247232,"Macroecological studies that require habitat suitability data for many species often derive this information from expert opinion. However, expert-based information is inherently subjective and thus prone to errors. The increasing availability of GPS tracking data offers opportunities to evaluate and supplement expert-based information with detailed empirical evidence. Here, we compared expert-based habitat suitability information from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with habitat suitability information derived from GPS-tracking data of 1,498 individuals from 49 mammal species.
Worldwide.
1998-2021.
Forty-nine terrestrial mammal species.
Using GPS data, we estimated two measures of habitat suitability for each individual animal: proportional habitat use (proportion of GPS locations within a habitat type), and selection ratio (habitat use relative to its availability). For each individual we then evaluated whether the GPS-based habitat suitability measures were in agreement with the IUCN data. To that end, we calculated the probability that the ranking of empirical habitat suitability measures was in agreement with IUCN's classification into suitable, marginal and unsuitable habitat types.
IUCN habitat suitability data were in accordance with the GPS data (> 95% probability of agreement) for 33 out of 49 species based on proportional habitat use estimates and for 25 out of 49 species based on selection ratios. In addition, 37 and 34 species had a > 50% probability of agreement based on proportional habitat use and selection ratios, respectively.
We show how GPS-tracking data can be used to evaluate IUCN habitat suitability data. Our findings indicate that for the majority of species included in this study, it is appropriate to use IUCN habitat suitability data in macroecological studies. Furthermore, we show that GPS-tracking data can be used to identify and prioritize species and habitat types for re-evaluation of IUCN habitat suitability data.",2022-10-18,"Maarten J E Broekman, Jelle P Hilbers, Mark A J Huijbregts, Thomas Mueller, Abdullahi H Ali, Henrik Andrén, Jeanne Altmann, Malin Aronsson, Nina Attias, Hattie L A Bartlam-Brooks, Floris M van Beest, Jerrold L Belant, Dean E Beyer, Laura Bidner, Niels Blaum, Randall B Boone, Mark S Boyce, Michael B Brown, Francesca Cagnacci, Rok Černe, Simon Chamaillé-Jammes, Nandintsetseg Dejid, Jasja Dekker, Arnaud L J Desbiez, Samuel L Díaz-Muñoz, Julian Fennessy, Claudia Fichtel, Christina Fischer, Jason T Fisher, Ilya Fischhoff, Adam T Ford, John M Fryxell, Benedikt Gehr, Jacob R Goheen, Morgan Hauptfleisch, A J Mark Hewison, Robert Hering, Marco Heurich, Lynne A Isbell, René Janssen, Florian Jeltsch, Petra Kaczensky, Peter M Kappeler, Miha Krofel, Scott LaPoint, A David M Latham, John D C Linnell, A Catherine Markham, Jenny Mattisson, Emilia Patricia Medici, Guilherme de Miranda Mourão, Bram Van Moorter, Ronaldo G Morato, Nicolas Morellet, Atle Mysterud, Stephen Mwiu, John Odden, Kirk A Olson, Aivars Ornicāns, Nives Pagon, Manuela Panzacchi, Jens Persson, Tyler Petroelje, Christer Moe Rolandsen, David Roshier, Daniel I Rubenstein, Sonia Saïd, Albert R Salemgareyev, Hall Sawyer, Niels Martin Schmidt, Nuria Selva, Agnieszka Sergiel, Jared Stabach, Jenna Stacy-Dawes, Frances E C Stewart, Jonas Stiegler, Olav Strand, Siva Sundaresan, Nathan J Svoboda, Wiebke Ullmann, Ulrich Voigt, Jake Wall, Martin Wikelski, Christopher C Wilmers, Filip Zięba, Tomasz Zwijacz-Kozica, Aafke M Schipper, Marlee A Tucker",game,0

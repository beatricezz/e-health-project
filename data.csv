Patients with Radiculopathy Have Worse Baseline Disability and Greater Improvements Following Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion Compared to Patients with Myelopathy.,10.1016/j.spinee.2022.10.005,36257530,"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is commonly performed in patients with radiculopathy and myelopathy. Although the goal of surgery in patients with radiculopathy is to improve function and reduce pain, patients with myelopathy undergo surgery to halt disease progression. Although the expectations between these preoperative diagnoses are generally understood to be disparate by spine surgeons, there is limited literature demonstrating their discordant outcomes.
To compare improvements in patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for patients undergoing ACDF for myelopathy or radiculopathy. Secondarily, we analyzed the proportion of patients who attain the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) postoperatively using thresholds derived from radiculopathy, myelopathy, and mixed cohort studies.
Single institution retrospective cohort study PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients undergoing primary, elective ACDF with a preoperative diagnosis of radiculopathy or myelopathy and a complete set of preoperative and one-year postoperative PROMs.
Outcome measures included the following PROMs: Short-Form 12 Physical Component (PCS-12) and Mental Component (MCS-12) scores, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Arm score, and the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Hospital readmissions and revision surgery were also collected and evaluated.
Patients undergoing an ACDF from 2014 to 2020 were identified and grouped based on preoperative diagnosis (radiculopathy or myelopathy). We utilized ""general MCID"" thresholds from a cohort of patients with degenerative spine conditions, and ""specific MCID"" thresholds generated from cohorts of patients with myelopathy or radiculopathy, respectively. Multivariate linear regressions were performed for delta (∆) PROMs and multivariate logistic regressions were performed for both general and specific MCID improvements.
A total of 798 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients with myelopathy had better baseline function and arm pain (MCS-12: 49.6 vs. 47.6, p=0.018; VAS Arm: 3.94 vs. 6.02, p<0.001; and NDI: 34.1 vs. 41.9, p<0.001), were older (p<0.001), had more comorbidities (p=0.014), more levels fused (p<0.001), and had decreased improvement in PROMs following surgery compared to patients with radiculopathy (∆PCS-12: 4.76 vs. 7.21, p=0.006; ∆VAS Arm: -1.69 vs. -3.70, p<0.001; and ∆NDI: -11.94 vs. -18.61, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, radiculopathy was an independent predictor of increased improvement in PCS-12 (β=2.10, p=0.019), ∆NDI (β=-5.36, p<0.001), and ∆VAS Arm (β=-1.93, p<0.001). Radiculopathy patients were more likely to achieve general MCID improvements following surgery (NDI: Odds ratio (OR): 1.42, p=0.035 and VAS Arm: OR: 2.98, p<0.001), but there was no difference between patients with radiculopathy or myelopathy when using radiculopathy and myelopathy specific MCID thresholds (MCS-12: p=0.113, PCS-12: p=0.675, NDI: p=0.108, and VAS Arm: p=0.314).
Patients undergoing ACDF with myelopathy or radiculopathy represent two distinct patient populations with differing treatment indications and clinical outcomes. Compared to radiculopathy, patients with myelopathy have better baseline function, decreased improvement in PROMs, and are less likely to reach MCID using general threshold values, but there is no difference in the proportion reaching MCID when using specific threshold values.

Detection and Management of Tethered Cord in Anorectal Malformation: A Survey of Pediatric Neurosurgeons in the United States.,10.1159/000527389,36257293,"The reported prevalence of tethered spinal cord in patients with anorectal malformations (ARM) ranges from 9% to 64%. Practice patterns surrounding the diagnosis and management of tethered cord are suspected to vary, with consideration to type of spine imaging, adjunct imaging modalities, what patients are offered surgical intervention, and how patients are followed after detethering. We sought to determine what consensus, if any, exists among pediatric neurosurgeons in the United States in terms of diagnosis and management of tethered cord and specifically, patients with tethered cord and ARM.
A survey was sent to members of the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons (ASPN). Members of the ASPN received an email with a link to an anonymous REDCap survey that asked about their experience with detethering procedures, indications for surgery, diagnostic tools used, and follow-up protocols.
The survey was completed by 93 of the 192 ASPN members (48%). When respondents were asked about the total number of all simple filum detetherings they performed annually, 61% (N=57) indicated they perform less than 10 for all tethered cord patients (TC). Ninety-three percent (N=87) of neurosurgeons performed these procedures in patients with simple filum tethered cord and ARM patients (TC + ARM) specifically. When asked about prophylactic detethering in those with a confirmed diagnosis of low lying conus and with a filum fatty terminale, 59.1% (N=55) indicated they would offer this to TC + ARM patients regardless of their age. Regarding pre-operative workup for simple filum detethering, all respondents indicated they would order an MRI in both TC and TC + ARM patients, with a minority also requiring additional testing such as urodynamics, neuro-developmental assessments, and anorectal manometry for both groups. When following patients post-operatively, almost all respondents indicated they would require clinical neurosurgical follow-up with a clinic visit (100% in all simple filum TC patients, 98.9% in fatty filum/low lying conus TC + ARM patients), but there was wide variation in the use of other tools such as urological testing, neurodevelopmental assessment, and anorectal manometry.
A wide variety of diagnostic criteria and indication for procedural intervention exists for management of tethered cord patients with and without ARM. Further studies are needed to determine outcomes. Prospective protocols need to be developed and evaluated to standardize care for this patient population and determine best practices.",2022-10-19,"Caitlin A Smith, Lauren N Nicassio, Samuel E Rice-Townsend, Jeffrey R Avansino, Jason S Hauptman",arm,1
Mindfulness-based stress reduction with acupressure for sleep quality in breast cancer patients with insomnia undergoing chemotherapy: A randomized controlled trial.,10.1016/j.ejon.2022.102219,36257214,"The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), acupressure, and MBSR combined with acupressure in improving sleep quality in breast cancer patients with sleep disorders, as well as the potential effects of these interventions on relieving fatigue, anxiety, and depression.
A four-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Fujian between July 2019 and January 2021. A total of 147 breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to a usual care group (n = 34), a MBSR group (n = 38), an acupressure group (n = 36), or a combined group (n = 39). We assessed patients' sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-PSQI and 6 actigraphy indices), fatigue, anxiety, and depression at baseline and at the mid-intervention (fourth week) and the end of intervention (eighth week).
The ANOVA showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in PSQI, and all sleep parameters measured by wrist actigraphy, and anxiety between groups. The three active treatments led to better PSQI outcomes (p < 0.001), reduced fatigue (p < 0.001), decreased anxiety (p < 0.05), and improved sleep measured by all actigraphy indices with two exceptions (MBSR did not differ from control on Sleep Latency (p = 0.235) and mean waking by time (MWBT) (p = 0.058)). Both acupressure and the combined intervention outperformed MBSR on four actigraphy indices: Sleep Efficiency (SE), Sleep Latency (SL), Totatl Sleep Time (TST), and Wake after sleep onset (WASO) (p < 0.05), and the combined intervention further outperformed MBSR on PSQI (p = 0.03) and Number of awakings (NOA) (p = 0.003). Moreover, there was no significant difference across all outcomes between acupressure and combined intervention (p ≥ 0.05).
MBSR, acupressure, and combined therapy all show a remarkable advantages in allemiating sleep quality, fatigue, and anxiety. Acupressure and combined therapy outperformed MBSR in improving sleep quality.",2022-10-19,"Qixi Liu, Chunfeng Wang, Ying Wang, Wenkui Xu, Chenju Zhan, Jinqing Wu, Rong Hu",arm,0
The association of hormone therapy with blood pressure control in postmenopausal women with hypertension: a secondary analysis of the Women's Health Initiative clinical trials.,10.1097/GME.0000000000002086,36256926,"The objective of this study was to assess the effect of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) on blood pressure control in postmenopausal women with hypertension.
The Women's Health Initiative HT clinical trials were double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of women aged 50 to 79 years testing the effects of HT (conjugated equine estrogens [CEE, 0.625 mg/d] or CEE + medroxyprogesterone acetate [MPA; 2.5 mg/d]) on risks for coronary heart disease and invasive breast cancer, the primary outcomes for efficacy and safety, respectively. This secondary analysis of the Women's Health Initiative HT trials examined a subsample of 9,332 women with hypertension (reported ever taking pills to treat hypertension or were taking antihypertensive medication) at baseline. Blood pressure was measured at baseline and up to 10 annual follow-up visits during the planned study phase. Antihypertensive medications were inventoried at baseline and years 1, 3, 6, and 9 during the study, and self-reported during extended follow-up: 2009-2010 and 2012-2013, which occurred median of 13 and 16 years after randomization, respectively. The intervention effect was estimated through year 6. Cumulative follow-up included all visits.
Compared with placebo, CEE-alone had significantly (P = 0.02) higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) by mean (95% confidene interval [CI]) = 0.9 (0.2-1.5) mm Hg during the intervention phase. For cumulative follow-up, the CEE arm was associated with increased SBP by mean (95% CI) = 0.8 (0.1-1.4) mm Hg (P = 0.02). Furthermore, CEE + MPA relative to placebo was associated with increased SBP by mean (95% CI) = 1.8 (1.2-2.5) mm Hg during the intervention phase (P < 0.001). For cumulative follow-up, the CEE + MPA arm was associated with increased SBP by mean (95% CI) = 1.6 (1.0-2.3) mm Hg (P < 0.001). The mean number of antihypertensive medications taken at each follow-up visit did not differ between randomization groups during the intervention or long-term extended follow-up of 16 years.
There was a small but statistically significant increase in SBP in both CEE-alone and CEE + MPA arms compared with placebo during both the intervention and cumulative follow-up phases among postmenopausal women with hypertension at baseline. However, this increase in SBP was not associated with an increased antihypertensive medication use over time among women randomized to HT compared with placebo.",2022-10-19,"Xuezhi Jiang, Aaron K Aragaki, Matthew Nudy, JoAnn E Manson, Aladdin H Shadyab, Robert A Wild, Carolina Valdiviezo, Margery Gass, Lisa Warsinger Martin, Kathy Pan, Marcia L Stefanick, John A Robbins, Peter F Schnatz",arm,0
StatPearls,,36256762,"Brachioplasty is also referred to as an 'upper arm lift procedure.' Nearly 20,000 upper arm lifts were performed in 2019, an increase of 20% from 2015.[1] It is most commonly performed for patients following massive weight loss (MWL), and 256,000 bariatric procedures were performed in 2019, representing a 31% increase in these operations performed since 2015.[2]  Other patient groups that may request brachioplasty include patients presenting following pregnancy and aging (senile) brachial laxity. Excess skin and ptosis can result in functional problems such as intertrigo, poor hygiene, infections, and psychosocial morbidity.[3][4] Furthermore, body contouring procedures, including brachioplasty following bariatric surgery, improve satisfaction, function, and quality of life and reduces BMI, and aid weight loss.[5][6] Brachioplasty entails the excision of excess skin and lipodystrophy of the upper arm, which can extend onto the lateral chest wall. Patient assessment and classification of the degree of skin and subcutaneous fat excess are crucial to identify the most appropriate procedure for each patient. This is because alternatives to brachioplasty can include liposuction and liposuction combined with brachioplasty; additionally, there are variations of brachioplasty depending on the scar length and placement. Several classification systems exist, which can guide the surgeon in selecting the most appropriate procedure.[7][8][9]",2022,"Nalin Nagrath, Ryan Winters",arm,0
